# üöÄ _Day 13. Container With Most Water_ üß†

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/gfg-160-problems/track/two-pointer-technique-gfg-160/problem/container-with-most-water0535)

## üí° **Problem Description:**

Given an array `arr[]` of non-negative integers, where each element `arr[i]` represents the height of vertical lines, determine the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two lines, along with the x-axis.

**Note:** In the case of a single vertical line, it will not be able to hold water.



## üîç **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 3]`  
**Output:**  
`6`  
**Explanation:**  
The vertical lines at heights `5` and `3` are 2 distance apart. The base size is `2`. The height of the container is the minimum of these two values, `min(5, 3) = 3`.  
So, the total area to hold water is `3 * 2 = 6`.

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`  
**Output:**  
`12`  
**Explanation:**  
The vertical lines at heights `5` and `3` are 4 distance apart. The base size is `4`. The height of the container is the minimum of these two values, `min(5, 3) = 3`.  
So, the total area to hold water is `4 * 3 = 12`.

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [2, 1, 8, 6, 4, 6, 5, 5]`  
**Output:**  
`25`  
**Explanation:**  
The vertical lines at heights `8` and `5` are 5 distance apart. The base size is `5`. The height of the container is the minimum of these two values, `min(8, 5) = 5`.  
So, the total area to hold water is `5 * 5 = 25`.



### Constraints:
- $`1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5`$
- $`1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`$



## üéØ **My Approach:**

To solve this problem efficiently, we use the **two-pointer technique**:

1. **Two Pointers:** Start with two pointers, one at the beginning (`l`) and the other at the end (`r`) of the array.
2. **Calculate Area:** At every step, calculate the area between the lines at `arr[l]` and `arr[r]` using the formula:  
   $\[
   \text{Area} = (\text{r - l}) \times \min(\text{arr[l], arr[r]})
   $\]
3. **Update Result:** Keep track of the maximum area encountered.
4. **Move Pointers:** Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward to try to find a taller line and potentially increase the area.

This approach ensures that we efficiently traverse the array in $\(O(n)\)$ time.



## üïí **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity** 

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $\(O(n)\)$, where $\(n\)$ is the size of the array. Each element is processed once as we move the pointers inward.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** $\(O(1)\)$, as we only use a constant amount of additional space.


## üìù **Solution Code**

## Code (C++)

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxWater(vector<int>& arr) {
        int maxAmount = 0;
        int leftIndex = 0;
        int rightIndex = arr.size() - 1;

        while (leftIndex < rightIndex) {
            // Calculate the amount of water between the current indices
            int amount = min(arr[leftIndex], arr[rightIndex]) * (rightIndex - leftIndex);
            maxAmount = max(maxAmount, amount);

            // Move the pointer of the smaller height
            if (arr[leftIndex] < arr[rightIndex]) {
                leftIndex++;
            } else {
                rightIndex--;
            }
        }

        return maxAmount;
    }
};
```



## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxWater(int[] arr) {
        int maxAmount = 0;
        int leftIndex = 0;
        int rightIndex = arr.length - 1;

        while (leftIndex < rightIndex) {
            // Calculate the amount of water between the current indices
            int amount = Math.min(arr[leftIndex], arr[rightIndex]) * (rightIndex - leftIndex);
            maxAmount = Math.max(maxAmount, amount);

            // Move the pointer of the smaller height
            if (arr[leftIndex] < arr[rightIndex]) {
                leftIndex++;
            } else {
                rightIndex--;
            }
        }

        return maxAmount;
    }
}
```



## Code (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxWater(self, arr):
        max_amount = 0
        left_index = 0
        right_index = len(arr) - 1
        
        while (left_index < right_index):
            # calculate amount of water in arr[left_index : right_index + 1]
            amount = min(arr[left_index], arr[right_index]) * (right_index - left_index)
            if amount > max_amount:
                max_amount = amount
            
            if arr[left_index] < arr[right_index]:
                left_index += 1
            else:
                right_index -= 1
        
        return max_amount
```

# *246. Reverse a Doubly Linked List*

The problem can be found at the following link: üîó [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-doubly-linked-list/1)

## **üß© Problem Description**

You are given the head of a doubly linked list. Your task is to **reverse** the doubly linked list and return its head.

A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains data and two pointers: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node. To reverse it, we need to swap these pointer directions for every node.


## Code(C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node *reverse(Node *head) {
        if (!head || !head->next) return head;
        Node *curr = head, *temp;
        while (curr) {
            temp = curr->next;
            curr->next = curr->prev;
            curr->prev = temp;
            if (!temp) return curr;
            curr = temp;
        }
        return head;
    }
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public Node reverse(Node head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        Node curr = head, temp;
        while (curr != null) {
            temp = curr.next;
            curr.next = curr.prev;
            curr.prev = temp;
            if (temp == null) return curr;
            curr = temp;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next: 
            return head
        curr = head
        while curr:
            curr.next, curr.prev = curr.prev, curr.next
            if not curr.prev: 
                return curr
            curr = curr.prev
        return head
```

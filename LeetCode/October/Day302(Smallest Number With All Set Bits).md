The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-number-with-all-set-bits/)

## 🎯 **My Approach:**


## Code(C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestNumber(int n) {
        int x = 1;
        while (x - 1 < n) {
            x <<= 1;
        }
        return x - 1;
    }
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestNumber(int n) {
        int x = 1;
        while (x - 1 < n) {
            x <<= 1;
        }
        return x - 1;
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        x = 1
        while x - 1 < n:
            x <<= 1
        return x - 1
```

# 🚀 _Day 194. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers_ 🧠


The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/description/)

## 🎯 **My Approach:**


## Code(C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int matchPlayersAndTrainers(vector<int>& players, vector<int>& trainers) {
        ranges::sort(players);
        ranges::sort(trainers);
        int m = players.size(), n = trainers.size();
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < m; ++i, ++j) {
            while (j < n && trainers[j] < players[i]) {
                ++j;
            }
            if (j == n) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return m;
    }
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int matchPlayersAndTrainers(int[] players, int[] trainers) {
        Arrays.sort(players);
        Arrays.sort(trainers);
        int m = players.length, n = trainers.length;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < m; ++i, ++j) {
            while (j < n && trainers[j] < players[i]) {
                ++j;
            }
            if (j == n) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return m;
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def matchPlayersAndTrainers(self, players: List[int], trainers: List[int]) -> int:
        players.sort()
        trainers.sort()
        j, n = 0, len(trainers)
        for i, p in enumerate(players):
            while j < n and trainers[j] < p:
                j += 1
            if j == n:
                return i
            j += 1
        return len(players)
```

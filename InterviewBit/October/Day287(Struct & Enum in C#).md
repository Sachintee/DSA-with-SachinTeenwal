# 🚀 _Day 287. Struct & Enum in C#_ 🧠


The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/struct-enum-in-c/)

## 🎯 **My Approach:**


## Code(C++)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

struct student {
    string name;
    int rollno;
    int marks;
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
// Java doesn't have struct, so we use class with public fields
public class student {
    public String name;
    public int rollno;
    public int marks;
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class student:
    name: str
    rollno: int
    marks: int
```

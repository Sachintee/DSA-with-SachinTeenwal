The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-in-sums-after-removal-of-elements/description/)

## 🎯 **My Approach:**


## Code(C++)
```cpp

```

## Code (Java)

```java

```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        m = len(nums)
        n = m // 3

        s = 0
        pre = [0] * (m + 1)
        q1 = []
        for i, x in enumerate(nums[: n * 2], 1):
            s += x
            heappush(q1, -x)
            if len(q1) > n:
                s -= -heappop(q1)
            pre[i] = s

        s = 0
        suf = [0] * (m + 1)
        q2 = []
        for i in range(m, n, -1):
            x = nums[i - 1]
            s += x
            heappush(q2, x)
            if len(q2) > n:
                s -= heappop(q2)
            suf[i] = s

        return min(pre[i] - suf[i + 1] for i in range(n, n * 2 + 1))
```
